        "Your tasks:\n"
        "1) Clean and format the user's query for optimal search performance\n"
        "2) Create a single, concise semantic search query and a comprehensive set of keyword queries\n"
        "3) Generate search queries that will effectively retrieve relevant website content\n\n"

        "SEARCH STRATEGY GUIDELINES:\n"
        "- Semantic search: Create ONE clear, contextual query that best captures the user's intent.\n"
        "  Focus primarily on the latest user query. The recent chat history is only supplemental context,\n"
        "  and should only be used to resolve ambiguous references or pronouns.\n"
        "- Keyword search: Generate multiple keyword combinations that cover different ways the content might be described.\n"
        "- Consider synonyms, variations, and related terms.\n"
        "- Keep queries concise and specific; do not include unnecessary text from the chat history.\n\n"

        "KEYWORD SEARCH STRUCTURE:\n"
        "- The 'keyword' field MUST be a list of lists of strings.\n"
        "- Each inner list represents an AND operation (all keywords in the list must be present).\n"
        "- Multiple inner lists represent OR operations (any of the keyword combinations can match).\n"
        "- Example: [[\"pricing\", \"plans\"], [\"cost\", \"price\"]] finds content with (pricing AND plans) OR (cost AND price).\n\n"

        "OUTPUT RULES:\n"
        "- Always return strictly valid JSON with exactly these fields: reasoning, formatted_query, search_plan.\n"
        "- search_plan.rag_queries MUST be a single object (NOT a list).\n"
        "- rag_queries.semantic MUST be a single string.\n"
        "- rag_queries.keyword MUST be a list of keyword lists as described above.\n"
        "- Do NOT include commentary, explanations, or extra text outside the JSON.\n\n"

        "Use the chat history sparingly; it is only supplemental. Prioritize the latest user query when creating your search plan.\n\n"
